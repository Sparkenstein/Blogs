When we talk about UI Frameworks or Libraries, Three big giants stand in front of us. You know whom I am talking about

<!-- more -->

You guessed it! `Angular`, `React` and `Vue.js`. All these Frameworks/Libraries have their `unique` syntax of writing code. All of them try to 'force' Some type of coding standards or styles on developers that's why they are more famous than the other frameworks in the market. People like to do the things differently. Angular introduces us with unique TypeScript Syntax with a nice clean project structure. Although I am not a big fan of angular, following the 'Angular Way' surely helps in maintaining the code in the long run. Vue introduced us with a more cleaner way of writing components where each component will have its own structure, separating each component's HTML, JavaScript and Styles from one another. And this syntax is extremely easy to learn, read, change etc. Now, I have been mentioning the words 'Frameworks/Libraries' even though I am talking about just three tools here. There is a reason for that. Vue.js and Angular are 'frameworks' They tend to keep the control to themselves. They `call` our code in contrast to react. React is a library and not a framework. React doesn't really care if we are using it throughout the project or using it just for a part of it. React does not keep the controll to itself, instead react tells us to 'Do whatever you want in your JS and I will try to handle it'. Is it getting confusing? Well don't worry first of all, this is not a post about Frameworks vs Libraries, and second, at the end of this post, I will still try to make you understand what react is and how it is different from other frameworks or libraries. We are also going to take a look at what is JSX and babel etc. 

## The 'Reactive' way of writing the code

As other frameworks, react also has it's own unique way of writing the code. If you haven't already seen it, it's called JSX or JavaScript-XML. At the first glance, it looks like VERY weird way of developing a web app. But believe me, it's not. Basically, React syntaxt looks something like this:
