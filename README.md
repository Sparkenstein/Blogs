Recently I started learning JavaScript. There is a cool channel I follow on Telegram called the devs. They have many dedicated groups for discussion on technologies like Go, Android, Machine Learning and what not. for more info follow: [the devs](https://thedevs.network/) on telegram
They also have a blog where even you can write your own content.
this repository is mu humble attempt to start writing blogs while learning JavaScript.
