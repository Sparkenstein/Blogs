# My Blogs
Recently I started learning JavaScript. it's going good so far. So I've decided to share the knowledge I gained while learning new technologies with you guys.

Also, there is a cool channel I follow on Telegram called `the devs`. They have many dedicated groups for discussion on technologies like Go, Android, Machine Learning and what not. for more info follow: [the devs](https://thedevs.network/) on telegram
They also have a blog where even you can write your own content.
this repository is my humble attempt to start writing blogs on both sites (my personal blog and the devs network) while learning JavaScript.

The blogs on [fosslife](www.fosslife.com) are hosted on AWS are managed with [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/).
