# Myself

Hello, My name is Spark (Not the real one of course). I am a Python developer. I like to learn new technologies as well. I am currently
learning JavaScript from kyle Simpson's [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS) Book. Besides that I like to 
Teach. So I am starting to write this blog. 

This blog was first meant to be about OpenSource technologies and Daily OpenSource news etc. That's why I brought the domain `fosslife`. 
But then I got distracted and decided to write on whatever I want, mostly, JavaScript and Python. Which includes but not limited to
New/Old JavaScript UI Frameworks, Node.js, JavaScript Libraries, Machine learning in both JavaScript and Python, tensorflow and 
tensorflow.js and IF time permits, coding challenges in `p5.js` as well. 

In future I just 'may' convert this static blog to something awesome like I'd planned already. But till then enjoy this blog of randomness.
